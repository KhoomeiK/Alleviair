          <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
          <p>It is Alleviair's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
            our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a
              href="https://alleviair.herokuapp.com">https://alleviair.herokuapp.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
            "https://alleviair.herokuapp.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
            identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
            ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information,
            and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies
            only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from
            other sources.</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
            rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
            Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
          <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
          <p>Like most website operators, Alleviair collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Alleviair's purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how Alleviair's visitors use its website. From time to time,
            Alleviair may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report
            on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
          <p>Alleviair also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Location data for users who
            contact our Facebook Messenger chatbot. Alleviair only discloses location data under the same circumstances
            that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
          <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
          <p>Certain visitors to Alleviair's websites choose to interact with Alleviair in ways that require Alleviair
            to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Alleviair gathers
            depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who contact our Facebook Messenger
            chatbot to provide their location. This location is not attached to a name, IP address, or any other
            Personally-Identifying Information unless provided by the user while contacting our chatbot.</p>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
            over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
          <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Alleviair may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
            and in Alleviair's sole discretion. Alleviair encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
            changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will
            constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
          <h3>Contact Information</h3>
          <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via <a
              href="mailto:migueltenant@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
